Dojo: Implementation Hub for Concepts Learning
Welcome to Dojo, a curated repository of foundational scripts designed for rapid implementation, conceptual clarity, and academic study. This repository serves as a personal "training hall" where complex mathematical, computational, and quantum theories are distilled into clean, executable Python code.

🎯 Repository Objective
The goal of this project is to provide high-quality "boilerplate" scripts that allow users to:

Rapidly Implement core algorithms in diverse technical domains.

Understand Concepts through practical, hands-on code interaction.

Edit & Experiment with parameters to study behavior and outcomes.

📂 Repository Structure
The Dojo is organized into specialized directories covering the pillars of modern science and engineering:

1. Matematica
Focuses on numerical methods and abstract structures.

Algebra_Abstrata: Exploring Galois extensions and groups.

Metodos_Numericos: Robust implementations of algorithms like Newton-Raphson for root finding.

Geometria & Calculo: Scripts covering Spherical Geometry and Jacobian matrix calculations.

Estatistica: Foundations of probability, including Expected Value and Variance.

2. Quantum_algo
Implementations using quantum frameworks (such as Qiskit) to demonstrate quantum supremacy and logic.

Includes scripts for Simon's Algorithm and other quantum gates/circuits.

3. Criptography_Cypherpunk
Practical explorations into privacy and security.

k-Anonimidade: Algorithms for data anonymization and privacy preservation.

Lattice-based Cryptography: Implementations of post-quantum standards like Kyber.

4. CS (Computer Science)
Foundational algorithms and complexity theory.

Complexity (Big O): Scripts demonstrating performance scaling and algorithmic efficiency.

Topological Sorting: Implementations for dependency resolution and graph theory.

5. GPU_nvidia
High-performance computing focusing on CUDA and hardware-level optimizations.

Scripts addressing technical concepts like Bank Conflicts in shared memory.

🚀 How to Use
Select a Topic: Navigate to the directory of interest.

Run the Script: Most scripts are standalone Python files.

Modify: Change the input variables (e.g., initial guesses in Newton-Raphson or noise levels in Quantum_algo) to see how the mathematical output responds.

🛠️ Requirements
